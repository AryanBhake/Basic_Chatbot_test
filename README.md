# Basic_Chatbot Using PyTorch

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of a contextual chatbot using PyTorch. Itâ€™s designed to be simple and easy to understand, especially for those new to deep learning and natural language processing.

The chatbot is powered by a feedforward neural network with two hidden layers and can be easily adapted to different conversational use cases.

## Installation
Install the required dependencies like pytorch, numpy, etc. Keep in mind to use nltk 'punkt_tab'.

```bash
pip install nltk
nltk.download('punkt_tab')
```
## Running
For convienience there is a Chatbot_master.ipynb file. To create new prompts, edit the intents.json file.
